Twitter Hate Speech Detection 

# Problem & Goal: 
- Employ a Hate Speech Detector.
- Determine which combination of pre-processing and model selection provides the best hate speech filter
- Goal is to classify tweets into two categories, hate speech or non-hate speech

As hate speech continues to be a societal problem, the need for automatic hate speech detection systems becomes more apparent. This project proposes a small step approach with an  idealism approach to combating hate speech. This project solution is using python programming language to build a machine learning model using bag of words (embeddings) and TF.IDF values aka NLP. techniques. A comparative analysis was deployed using multi classification algorithms 

The results showed that all models achieved a 95%+ high accuracy and f1.  KNN and Random Forest Classifier performed best with the IR/NLP approach.
